# qr-flappy-bird
## A clone of flappy bird written to fit on the QR code and run in any browser using the `data:text/html,` feature

![The Game](https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/qr-flappy-bird/assets/83996185/511640e4-d638-4101-900a-5e3812aad360) <br/>
This is the actual game :D

You can try it out at https://randomgamingdev.github.io/qr-flappy-bird/build/a.html and the HTML file, QR code, as well as `data:text/html,` based code designed to run anywhere are available under the [`build`](https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/qr-flappy-bird/tree/main/build) directory

This library uses https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/qr-cartridge to compile its code so make sure to have that installed. `build.sh` is how I personally call the compiler, but you can change it for whatever your needs are.

Here's the QR code which contains the code for the game. To play simply copy the text and paste it into the search bar of a compatible browser that accepts `data:text/html,` (aka try your browser, if for some reason it doesn't work try another). Something to note is that it's quite possible that it'll take a while to load from the URL since `data:text/html,` is like that for some reason, so if you see it loading wait until it loads.
