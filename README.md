![The Game](https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/qr-flappy-bird/assets/83996185/511640e4-d638-4101-900a-5e3812aad360) <br/>
This is the actual game :D

You can try it out at https://randomgamingdev.github.io/qr-flappy-bird/build/a.html and the HTML file, QR code, as well as `data:text/html,` based code designed to run anywhere are available under the [`build`](https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/qr-flappy-bird/tree/main/build) directory

This library uses https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/qr-cartridge to compile its code so make sure to have that installed. `build.sh` is how I personally call the compiler, but you can change it for whatever your needs are.
